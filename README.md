                        0.   A spark


As closer we are to the a concept model and to the prototype, 
we flight bare bones, fast to code and explore alternatives, 
careless discard of non promising paths and iterate, keeping all 
things simple, pure KISS, architecture to the point of almost 
not existing,  with complete disregard of future changes, expansions, 
and integration to other components. To flight we need lightweight. 
To get a grasp, and a taste, to satisfy our kraftlust, get impulse, 
go head first for an optimistic maybe or even an optimistic yes, 
if you are like me, it will suffice a folder, a zero lag editor 
for programmers, and a non verbose scripting language we know 
for ages, which doesn’t nag us with type declaration, resource 
devouring slow IDEs,  slow compilers. 

No. Just a folder, an editor, and a script.

Then the spark, the file, divides like that magic cell which 
started life. Functions born. Classes enclose affine functions 
as villages. Our spark file gets uncomfortable and splits.

We are moody creatures. 

No corp is taming us to standard compliance. An anarchic spirit 
flows in the code. No one rules our little digital world.

As the song from Michael Nyman claims: 
the heart demanded pleasure first. 

After a few days, if we are sensible fellows, we should feel 
unease of making destructive mistakes, losing files, entering 
a short but painful pathway or a rabbit hole we cannot 
return from. So, a version control system enters the game and 
we get bored we it’s simple albeit bureaucratic setup. 

Then our child grows. Masons enter to craft their medieval game 
and a cathedral dominates the village. 

Our beloved prototype must suffer a brutal dissection. 


               
                     1.   Masonry


Role play starts. The artisan, rogue programmer encounters 
the mason architect. We are brought in the dawn of architecture.  
Our beloved prototype must suffer a brutal dissection. 

We get the growingly amorphous albeit promising prototype a look 
from the distance, above, and the cliff. 

Architecture is built around and inside the prototype, major surgery. 
Our inner mason now rules. Our rogue programmer loss or at least 
share its power. To support an ample set of orbiting satellites 
that must to be in place to make it realistically usable; some 
typical ones: make it viable on a production environment, which 
doesn’t necessarily match the comfortable place we use to develop to 
the expected load. Besides, when things go south, take proper care 
of unexpected places we end up, be sure to be prepared to unavoidable 
fall, given enough hints for forensic analysis when or beast hits the 
floor hard. We have to be sure we can meet benchmarks to make it usable. 
We have to make it to play well with robust noble friendly beats, like 
components that proven not to be rusted by use and time. To be robust, 
to fit a good design for our purpose code refactor has to be done or 
-deities save us- rewrote from scratch.

Then the flow starts disappointingly to slow down, someone need to take 
care of boring stuff (hopefully not us, the quick and dirty rogue programmers).
